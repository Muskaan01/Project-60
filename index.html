            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>I am 11 years old. I study in Billabong High International School. Some of the things I like to do are spending time with friends, watching television, listening to songs, playing badminton and coding. But the thing I love most is reading. You can go to the 'Hobby' section to know more and the 'Books' one to know more about my favourite books. This is a website that I have created through Coding. It has information about me - what I like to do, what I want to achieve, and more. It even has my inspiration. To read in detail, select the 'Inspiration' section. Hope you like this website. </p>

        <h2>Reading Books</h2>
            
        <p>I love reading books. I find it an interesting thing to do. Books have always caught my attraction. I admire reading them in my free time. I study in the seventh grade and have lots of books that are taught in school as well. I like any book to read, but my favourite is the Harry Potter series. Those seven books transfer me to a completely different world, a magical world. I feel that lovely sensation when I read a book. It flows through my whole body. And reading also has many advantages. It gives you knowledge and helps you stay aware of your surroundings. Reading books is not just my hobby or pastime, but its something that keeps me out of the real world, the busy world. Reading keeps me happy and busy and I know will never get tired of it.</p>

            <p>J.K Rowling as an inspiration - 
            <br>
            <br>
            She was the author of Harry Potter and was the one to motivate me to read a lot of books and also introduce me to the Harry Potter World; the magical world I got sucked in as soon as I opened the first book.</p>

            Even though she is a fictional character, Hermione inspired me to study and keep working hard to achieve something in life, she motivated me to always be strong and stand up for myself as well as my friends.
